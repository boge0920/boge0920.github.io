### Deep Learning Tools/Softwares/Codes

"*I always use `Theano + Pylearn2 + ...` because they are all `Python` libraies, therefore, I can build a customized deep model easily and quickly. I also have tried `cuda-convent` and `CXXNET`, both of which are more efficiently.*"

* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) - CPU/GPU symbolic expression compiler in python (from LISA Lab @ University of Montreal)
	- [Tips for Improving Performance on GPU](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html#tips-for-improving-performance-on-gpu)

* [Pylarn2](http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/) - is a machine learning library. Most of its functionality is built on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/).

* [cuda-convent](https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/) - High-performance C++/CUDA implementation of convolutional neural networks, by [Alex Krizhevsky](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/).

* [CXXNET](https://github.com/antinucleon/cxxnet) - is a neural network toolkit build on [mshadow](https://github.com/tqchen/mshadow).

* [OverFeat](http://cilvr.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=software%3Aoverfeat%3Astart) - is a Convolutional Network-based image features extractor and classifier (from CILVR Lab @ NYU)

* [nnForge](http://milakov.github.io/nnForge/) - a library for training convolutional and fully-connected neural networks. It includes CPU and GPU (CUDA) backends.

* [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) - a framework for convolutional neural network algorithms, developed with speed in mind.
