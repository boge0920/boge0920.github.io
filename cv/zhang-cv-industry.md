5/2013 - present
:   Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong
:	\& Research Intern at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (Hong Kong)](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/), Hong Kong
\fi 

05/2013 - present
:   [**Huawei Noah's Ark Lab**](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/), Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong
:   Research Intern with [Dr. Wei Fan](http://www.weifan.info/)
:   *Research and develop large-scale deep learning and feature engineering algorithms.*
:   - \small Research on Transformational Learning (TL, the generation of deep learning). Using deep learning techniques with decision tree, model-based search tree or graphical models, TL can learn structure \& high-level knowledge representations from most kinds of data, included sequences, graphs, images, etc. \texttt{The draft is being prepared}. 

:   - \small Proposed a novel deep learning model named SUGAR. SUGAR regularizes the network construction by utilizing similarity or dissimilarity constraints between data pairs, rather than sample-specific annotations. Such kind of side information is more flexible and greatly mitigates the workload of annotators. Secondly, unlike prior works, SUGAR decouples the supervision information and intrinsic data structure. SUGAR includes two heterogeneous networks, each of which encodes either supervision or unsupervised data structure respectively. \texttt{The work has been presented at} [*KDD 2014*](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2014/). \texttt{Code:} <https://github.com/lucktroy/sugar>. 

:	- \small Proposed a novel algorithm (FSP-MbT) for mining discriminative and essential frequent sequential patterns via model-based search tree. It is the core component of the subsequent prediction model, which is used for the consumer complaint problem in the telecommunications industry. The related prediction system is being deployed and tested for real-world application, which includes millions of consumers. \texttt{Patent Pending}.

:	- \small Proposed a locally linear deep learning model (LLDL) for large-scale stellar spectrum recognition. The characteristics of stellar spectra: the massive volume, ultrahigh dimensionality (>5K), and significantly low signal/noise ratio (<10). Using GPU, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Dropout, LLDL can model the locally linear structures found in the stellar spectra. Experimental results show that LLDL achieves up to 100% improvements over both popular deep neural networks and shallow SVM and Logistic Regression. \texttt{Paper is under review}.
