  abstract = {Attribute reduction for big data is viewed as an important preprocessing
	step in the areas of pattern recognition, machine learning and data
	mining. In this paper, a novel parallel method based on MapReduce
	for large-scale attribute reduction is proposed. By using this method,
	several representative heuristic attribute reduction algorithms in
	rough set theory have been parallelized. Further, each of the improved
	parallel algorithms can select the same attribute reduct as its sequential
	version, therefore, owns the same classification accuracy. An extensive
	experimental evaluation shows that these parallel algorithms are
	effective for big data.},
